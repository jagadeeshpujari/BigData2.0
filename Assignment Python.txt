## Assignment Part-1
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?
Ans. Simple to use with Simple Syntax. Doesn’t require to understand the details of the computer to develop the program efficiently.

Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
Ans. We don't have to declare the type of a variable or manage the memory while assigning a value to a variable in Python

Ans. Web Applications

Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?
Ans.	A variable is used to represent an unknown character.
•	A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character.
•	A variable name cannot start with a number.
•	A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ ).
